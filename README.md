Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The proprietor of DriverPass intends to create a website for driver education.  The proprietor believes that a large number of pupils are failing because they are not receiving adequate training for driving. The customer, who is also the owner of Driver Pass, wants to develop a system that allows aspiring drivers to sign up for driving school. They want us to develop a system where users may set up their own accounts and choose the driving packages they desire. The users will have access to online training, online tests, and on-the-road instruction.  All of the employee and student accounts will be accessible to the owner.


What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did a good job of working on the system's designing needs.  The designing requirements were a very exact and important step in making this software.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would focus on the functional and non-functional needs because they are an essential component of the project and because projects change over time, they are never truly finished.  In order to prevent it from ever changing, I would like to be able to make it a little more stable.  Getting feedback from students and employers would help me make this better.  The most valuable feedback can come from customers who are actually using the software.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I wanted to be sure that I explained all of the demands placed on us.  In order to make it easier to work with, I made care to divide each component of the needs (the client, the student, the owner, and the staff).  The needs of the client are crucial since without the right needs, the project won't be helpful to them.  Basically, we couldn't finish the job without the specifications.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would like to first gather the requirements for the system's additional functions before I start designing the program.  I would then create the system and incorporate the additional functionality.I would like input so that I can examine it in the future.  Once I obtained the comments, I would want to think about the limitations of the system.  I could then start working on making any fixes or modifications that would make the system function.
